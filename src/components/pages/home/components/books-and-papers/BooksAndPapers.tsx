          You might ask yourself, is Hannes one of the superficial hipsters that
          tries to impress with how well read he is? <b>Fair question!</b>

          My answer would be that I maintain this list strictly to keep myself
          accountable to not buy even more books but stay focused on the topics
          I have planned to dive into. Over the years, I have also figured out
          that I learn in a very visual way. Even if you consider a book not as
          the classical visual medium, I often tend to recall and connect
          information based on the layout of text, code snippets and
          illustrations. That said, I probably should also add a category of
          very helpful Youtube videos I have watched over time.

          I got the inspiration for this list from
          <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/about/">Adrian Colyer</a> and his
          mailing list:{" "}
