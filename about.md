I am a software developer with a slight faible for web services and API design. The last 13 years, I have worked on
browser games, scalable websites, APIs and web applications.

I also lecture at the department of „Web-Engineering“ at the [University of Applied Sciences Salzburg](https://multimediatechnology.at/)
and have a lovely but crazy dog named Gismo.
